            <h1>"Those People": A play about Qanon</h1>
            <br></br>
            Those People: A Play About QAnon is based on interviews with young people from
            the UK, conducted online and from accounts written on the subreddit:
            r/QAnoncasualties. This performance addresses online extremism and explores why
            there is such mistrust, from young people especially, in our institutions and
            what we can do to better counteract misinformation. This piece was written
            shortly after former President Trumpâ€™s defeat to President Biden in the November
            2020 election. Since then, the QAnon conspiracy has continued to spread and gain
            traction in the US and across the world.
